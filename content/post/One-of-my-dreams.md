## One of My Dreams
I am writing this with a lot of courage and can be weird for you as well. When I first met you in the fall of 2016, your first semester, I hadn't thought it was going to be remembered for the rest of my life. 

I know i'm little weird, and have always been. I didn't have any interactions with girls all my life because I was introvert, not rich and beautiful. All my life I have been alone with my dreams. 
Dreams that help me moving forward. And one of my dreams is you. 
I don't know how it became so serious. I have tried many times not to think of you. I couldn't. 
You never asked, but I help you again and again just to stay in contact. 
I know you don't have any of these feelings. It's ok. That's why I said in the first line, it can be weird for you.
